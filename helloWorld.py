This is a very simple example of a python script.
The print statement will display any thing after the word print.
In this case, we are creating a "string" that says "Hello, World!"

A string is a alphabets, numbers and/or symbols.

This is a simple but important test, because it's one of the simplest ways to see if something is working.

P.S. If you're wondering, everything inside these triple quotes will not be run, and is just my commentary
"""
# P.P.S Anything after a # is also a comment and will not be run

print "Hello, World!"
